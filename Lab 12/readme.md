for compilation:

gcc -o lab lab12.c

for running 

./lab

==========================================================================================

the following are the variables used in the given code. 

1. `cmd`: An array of characters used to store the user input command. Its size is defined by `MAX_CMD_LENGTH`.
2. `fp`: A pointer to a `FILE` structure used to handle the file stream returned by `popen`.
3. `opt`: An array of characters used to store the output of the executed command. Its size is defined as 1024 characters.
4. `MAX_CMD_LENGTH`: A preprocessor macro defining the maximum length of the command input by the user.




1. **Header Files**: 
    - `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes standard input/output functions.
    - `#include <stdlib.h>`: Includes standard library functions.
    - `#include <string.h>`: Includes string manipulation functions.

2. **Preprocessor Directive**:
    - `#define MAX_CMD_LENGTH 100`: Defines a preprocessor macro `MAX_CMD_LENGTH` with a value of `100`. This is used to specify the maximum length of the command input by the user.

3. **Main Function** (`int main()`):
    - Declares three variables:
        - `cmd`: An array of characters to store the user input command.
        - `fp`: A pointer to a `FILE` structure used for file operations.
        - `opt`: An array of characters to store the output of the executed command.
    - Enters a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for commands and execute them until the user inputs "quit".
    - Inside the loop:
        - Prompts the user to enter a command using `printf`.
        - Reads the command entered by the user using `fgets` and stores it in the `cmd` variable.
        - Removes the trailing newline character from the command input by replacing it with a null character.
        - Checks if the user has entered "quit" to exit the loop and terminate the program.
        - Executes the command entered by the user using `popen` and stores the file stream in the `fp` variable.
        - If `popen` fails (returns `NULL`), it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
        - Reads the output of the command line by line using `fgets` and prints it to the terminal.
        - Closes the file stream opened by `popen` using `pclose`.

4. **Return Statement**:
    - Returns `0` to indicate successful execution of the program.

Overall, this program continuously prompts the user for commands, executes them using `popen`, and prints the output until the user inputs "quit" to exit the program.
